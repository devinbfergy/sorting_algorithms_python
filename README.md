# Sorting Algorithms in Python


This is just a demonstration of the implementation of some sorting algorithms using Python. There are implementations of
sorting in Python's standard library that are much better for performance reasons. 
When I wrote these codes I was learning Python and I wanted to do some exercises to improve my Python skills and then 
since I was taking Data Structures classes in college I implemented the algorithms in Python, I already knew  the most 
well-known sort algorithms, but I ended up getting myself excited and learning a few more as was the case with Comb, 
Gnome Cocktail and Shell Sort.

The following algorithms were implemented:

- Bubble
- Bucket
- Cocktail
- Comb
- Counting
- Gnome
- Heap
- Insertion
- Selection
- Merge
- Quick
- Radix
- Shell
