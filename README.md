# Sorting Algorithms in Python


This is just a demonstration of the implementation of some sorting algorithms using Python. There are implementations of
sorting in Python's standard library that are much better for performance reasons. 
When I wrote these codes I was learning Python and I wanted to do some exercises to improve my Python skills and then 
since I was taking Data Structures classes in college I implemented the algorithms in Python, I already knew  the most 
well-known sort algorithms, but I ended up getting myself excited and learning a few more as was the case with Comb, 
Gnome Cocktail and Shell Sort.

The following algorithms were implemented:

- Bubble
- Bucket
- Cocktail
- Comb
- Counting
- Gnome
- Heap
- Insertion
- Selection
- Merge
- Quick
- Radix
- Shell

The program shows the execution times of each algorithm, it is possible to create a random vector of integers and test 
it with all the algorithms for comparison purposes. It is nice to note that the difference in execution times of each 
algorithm grows as you use larger vectors. Small vectors are ordered quickly by any of these algorithms with a small 
time difference between them, but by increasing the vector sizes, it is seen that the more advanced algorithms like 
Quick, Merge, Bucket, Heap and Shell go absurdly better than the others.
